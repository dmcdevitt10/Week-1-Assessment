    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is where stacks come into play. You need to think of all the things you need in order for your software to perform and be successful'

const design = 'This is where you where you take the requirements for you software and decide what needs to happen first, their relationship with each other, and how you will go about building the software.'

const implementation = 'This is where you actually start to code and build your software'
